# SimplifiedSRS

Only works with the previous interval by either decreasing it (forgot: < 50% depending on the next rating , partially recalled: -25%) or increasing it (recalled with effort: +50%, easily recalled: +200%). Ignores when these cards are being practiced (i.e. practicing an overdue card does not skyrocket the interval).
